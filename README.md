# Red-Black Tree

This was a Red-Black Tree that I had to code for the CS Bridge Program at NYU Tandon.  We were tasked to create a self-balancing binary search tree using either AVL, or Red-Black (for extra credit).  We only had to cover insertions.

I plan on improving my algorithms, separating the code into header and class files, and to attempt to code deletions.  The code for deletions is already present (in the form of a comment), but it does not work for some cases.
